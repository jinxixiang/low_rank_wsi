We explore the low-rank property of whole slide images to develop a new multiple-instance learning paradigm. In concrete, we improve the performance in two stages:

1. We propose low-rank contrastive learning for pathology-specific visual representation.

2. We improve the vanilla transformer by adding a learnable low-rank matrix as a surrogate to implement higher-order interaction.

The code is coming soon...
